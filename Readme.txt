The scraper.py file contains the script which I have used to extract the data(articles) from a website.

All the extracted text is stored in the Extracted_text folder in format <URL_ID>.txt

The Text_analysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file which contains the analysis of all the articles.

Finally, the final_analysis.xlsx excel file contains all the results of text analysis.
